## Domain 1 
### 1.1 Code of Ethics 
* ISC^2 code of ethics 
  * Preamble 
  * Canons (4)
  * Complaints/ Violation 
* Organization Code of Ethics 
* Ethics & the internet RFC 1087 [IAB]
* Ten Commandment of computer ethics
* Code of fair information practices (5)
* Cybersecurity credentials collaborative C3
  * Integrity, objectivity, profissional, confidentiality.
### 1.2 CIA
* Confidentiality
  * &
  * Concealment 
  * Seclusion: storing in an out of the way location.
  * Isolation: Seperate from others.   
* Integrity
  * &
  * Oversight: an unintentional failure to notice or do something
  * Ineptitude: lack of skill or ability
* Availability
  * Depend on both of integrity & Encryption  
* Other security concepets 
  * Overprotection
    *   Overprotecting integrity can result in a restriction of availability.
    *   Over providing availability can result in loss of confidentiality and integrity.  
  * Authenticity: originates from its alleged source (the recipient can have a high level of confidance that the data is from whom it claims it be from)
  * Nonrepudiation: Digital Certificates, Session identifiers, transaction logs
  * AAA Service abbreviation refer to Authentication, Authorization, Accounting but it actually means the five elements: 
    * Identification: claming the be an identity.
    * Authentication: prove the identity (Identification and Authentication are single two steps process ) [passwords are the least secure].
    * Authorization: permission
    * Auditing: recording logs 
    * Accounting: review logs to check for compliance and violations
* Protection Mechanisms 
  * Defense in Depth:
    * a single failed control should not result in exposure of the system or data 
    * Serial configuration (oppsite that applicaiton new ideas)  
      * If parallel a threat could pass through a single checkpoint that did not address its particular malcious activity 
      * serial is very narrow but very deep, parallel is very wide but very shallow   
  * Abstraction: is used for efficiency, Similar elements are put into groups,classes, roles.(abstraction simplifes security).
    * thats is how to send input and receive output.

  * Data Hiding: subject cant see or access the data (not accesible)
    * Preventing application access hardware directly 
    * Insure that data existing at one level of security is not visble to process running at diffrent security level.
    * Data hiding is the act of intentionally positioning data so that it is not viewable or accessible to an unauthorized subject.   
  * Security through obscurity: hoping that no one will discover the issue and exploit it.
  * Encryption : :D

* Security Boundaries: 

### 1.3 Evaludate and apply security Governance Principles
